Project Structure
index.html: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the app.
styles.css: The CSS file that styles the app.
script.js: The JavaScript file that handles fetching and displaying the weather data.
How to Use
Write HTML Structure:

Open the index.html file in your text editor.
Set up the basic HTML structure with <!DOCTYPE html> and <html> tags.
Inside the <head> tag, add necessary meta tags, including character set and viewport settings.
Link your CSS file (styles.css) using the <link> tag inside the <head> section.
Create a <body> section to contain the content of your app.
Style Your App with CSS:

Open the styles.css file in your text editor.
Define styles for various elements of your weather app, including containers, text, and backgrounds.
Use classes and IDs to target specific elements and apply styles accordingly.
Consider using media queries to make your app responsive to different screen sizes.
Write JavaScript to Fetch Weather Data:

Open the script.js file in your text editor.
Define a function or event handler to fetch weather data from a weather API.
Choose a free weather API provider such as OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, or MetaWeather.
Use the fetch() method or an AJAX library like Axios to make a request to the API and retrieve weather information.
Parse the JSON response and extract relevant data such as temperature, description, and location.
Update the HTML content dynamically to display the retrieved weather information.
API Configuration
You may need to sign up for an API key from the weather API provider you choose. Replace any placeholders in script.js with your actual API key.
